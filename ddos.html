      <h3>DDoS - Distributed Denial of Service</h3>
      <p>Learn about the devastating impact of DDoS attacks and how to protect your systems from being overwhelmed.</p>

  <h4>Top Prevention Strategies:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <img src="./img/ddos-prevention1.png" alt="Network Security">
      <p>Network Security</p>
      <p>Implement robust network security measures to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks at the network level.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <img src="./img/ddos-prevention2.png" alt="Traffic Filtering">
      <p>Traffic Filtering</p>
      <p>Utilize traffic filtering techniques to identify and block malicious traffic before it reaches your servers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <img src="./img/ddos-prevention3.png" alt="Load Balancing">
      <p>Load Balancing</p>
      <p>Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload and ensure uninterrupted service.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <img src="./img/ddos-prevention4.png" alt="DDoS Mitigation Services">
	  <img src="./img/ddos-prevention4.jpg" alt="DDoS Mitigation Services">
      <p>DDoS Mitigation Services</p>
      <p>Consider partnering with DDoS mitigation service providers to leverage their expertise and resources.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <img src="./img/ddos-prevention5.png" alt="Incident Response Plan">
      <p>Incident Response Plan</p>
      <p>Develop a comprehensive incident response plan to minimize the impact of DDoS attacks and restore normal operations.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Common DDoS Attack Vectors:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <img src="./img/ddos-attack1.jpg" alt="UDP Flood">
      <p>UDP Flood</p>
      <p>A UDP Flood is a type of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, where the attacker sends a large volume of UDP packets to exhaust the target's system resources, such as bandwidth or processing capabilities, making it unable to serve legitimate users.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <img src="./img/ddos-attack2.png" alt="HTTP Flood">
      <p>HTTP Flood</p>
      <p>An HTTP Flood is a DDoS attack where the attacker generates a large number of seemingly legitimate HTTP requests, overwhelming the target server's resources like CPU, memory, etc., causing the target system to become unavailable.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <img src="./img/ddos-attack3.jpg" alt="SYN Flood">
      <p>SYN Flood</p>
      <p>A SYN Flood is a type of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack that exploits the TCP three-way handshake mechanism. <br><br>The attacker sends numerous TCP SYN packets with fake source IP addresses. The target system responds to each SYN packet with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet, maintaining a half-open connection. The attacker never completes the handshake by sending the final ACK packet, leaving the half-open connections to consume resources on the target system. <br><br>As the number of half-open connections increases, the target system runs out of resources to handle new legitimate connection requests, resulting in a denial of service.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <img src="./img/ddos-attack4.jpg" alt="ICMP Flood">
      <p>ICMP Flood</p>
      <p>An ICMP Flood is a DDoS attack where the attacker sends a large number of ICMP echo request (ping) packets to the target system, causing it to become preoccupied with processing these ICMP packets, unable to provide normal services. This attack aims to consume the target system's network bandwidth and processing capacity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <img src="./img/ddos-attack5.png" alt="DNS Amplification">
      <p>DNS Amplification</p>
      <p>DNS Amplification is a DDoS attack where the attacker abuses open and vulnerable DNS servers to send a large number of DNS queries to the target. These queries are then amplified by the DNS servers, resulting in much larger response packets being forwarded to the target, eventually exhausting its resources. This attack leverages the design and network topology of the DNS infrastructure to amplify the attack impact.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
